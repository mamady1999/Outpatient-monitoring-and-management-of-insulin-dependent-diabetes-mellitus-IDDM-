# Outpatient-monitoring-and-management-of-insulin-dependent-diabetes-mellitus-IDDM-

### Problem : 

Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, now known as diabetes mellitus type 1, an autoimmune disease resulting in the destruction of insulin-producing cells.
Patients with IDDM are insulin deficient. This can either be due to a)
low or absent production of insulin by the beta islet cells of the
pancreas subsequent to an auto-immune attack or b) insulin-resistance,
typically associated with older age and obesity, which leads to a
relative insulin-deficiency even though the insulin levels might be
normal.

Regardless of cause, the lack of adequate insulin effect has multiple
metabolic effects. However, once a patient is diagnosed and is
receiving regularly scheduled exogenous (externally administered)
insulin, the principal metabolic effect of concern is the potential
for hyperglycemia (high blood glucose). Chronic hyperglycemia over a
period of several years puts a patient at risk for several kinds of
micro and macrovascular problems (e.g. retinopathy). Consequently, the
goal of therapy for IDDM is to bring the average blood glucose as close
to the normal range as possible. As explained below, current therapy
makes this goal a very challenging (and often frustrating) one for
most patients. One important consideration is that due to the
inevitable variation of blood glucose (BG) around the mean, a lower mean
will result in a higher frequency of unpleasant and sometimes
dangerous low BG levels.


**Outpatient management :**

Outpatient management of IDDM relies principally on three
interventions: diet, excercise and exogenous insulin. Proper treatment
requires careful consideration of all three interventions. 

### Objectives

Our goal in this project is to use machine learning techniques to classify patients into one of the following categories:

**1.hyperglycemia (When the average blood glucose level exceeds 200 over several years.)**

**2.hypoglycemia (low BG) symptoms fall into two classes. Between 40-80 mg/dl**

**3.normal** : 

    A normal pre-meal BG ranges approximately 80-120 mg/dl. 
    A normal post-meal BG ranges 80-140 mg/dl. 
    The target range for an individual with diabetes mellitus is very controversial.
    I will cut the Gordian knot on this issue by noting that it would be very desirable to keep 90% of all BG 
    measurements < 200 mg/dl and that the average BG should be 150 mg/dl or less.
